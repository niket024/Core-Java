Serialization:
------------------
process of writing object state into file.
object state is in binary formate (byte code).
it is one of the unsecured operation.
to perform the serialization we need to implements 
It is a object wise operation
Serializable interface.
it is one of the marker interface.
it is one of the object wise operation
marker interface
----------------
an interface which is not having any method inside their body.
eg.Serializable,Clonnable,etc
A a1=new A();

transient keyword
--------------
to customize the serialization process.
which ever variable is having transient keyword that is not
participating into serialization

Uses of serialVersionUID:
------------------------
During serialization, java runtime associates a version number with each serializable class. 
This number called serialVersionUID, 
which is used during deserialization to verify that the sender and 
receiver of a serialized object have loaded classes for that object that are compatible with respect to serialization.
for eg. if you serialize the object and then you change the attribute of that class or object
then deserialization will fail.
to avoid this you need to add serialVersionUID

If you not add serialVersionUID then JVM will add including all the attribute so if you change any attribute the it will
be a mismatch hence desialization will be failed.

Externalization
---------------------
To customize the Serialization process
It is attribute wise operation
