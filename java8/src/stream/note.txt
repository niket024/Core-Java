Intermediate operations
------------------------
Intermediate operations return the stream itself so you can chain multiple method calls in a row. Let’s learn important ones.

eg. Stream.filter(), Stream.sorted() etc
Filter accepts a predicate to filter all elements of the stream. 
This operation is intermediate which enables us to call another stream operation (e.g. forEach) on the result.

Terminal operations
--------------------
Terminal operations return a result of a certain type instead of again a Stream.

eg.Stream.forEach(), Stream.collect()
This method helps in iterating over all elements of a stream and perform some operation on each of them.
 The operation is passed as lambda expression parameter.
