Stream.reduce()
-------
This terminal operation performs a reduction on the elements of the stream with the given function.
 The result is an Optional holding the reduced value.
 
 Parallelism in Java Steam
 -------------------------
 With the Fork/Join framework added in Java SE 7,
 we have efficient machinery for implementing parallel operations in our applications
 But implementing this framework is itself a complex task; and if not done right;
 is a source of complex multi-threading bugs having potential to crash the application.
 With the introduction of internal iteration, we got the possibility of operations to be done in parallel.

To enable parallelism, all you have to do is to create a parallel stream, instead of sequential stream.
 And to surprise you, this is really very easy. In any of above listed stream examples,
 anytime you want to particular job using multiple threads in parallel cores,
 all you have to call method parallelStream() method instead of stream() method.
