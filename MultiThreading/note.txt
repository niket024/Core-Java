CountDownLatch 
----------------
A java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch is a concurrency construct that allows one 
or more threads to wait for a given set of operations to complete

await()
-----------
Causes the current thread to wait until the latch has counted down to zero,
unless the thread is interrupted. 
If the current count is zero then this method returns immediately. 

CyclicBarrier 
-------------------
It is a synchronization mechanism that can synchronize threads progressing through some algorithm
In other words, it is a barrier that all threads must wait at, until all threads reach it, 
before any of the threads can continue
