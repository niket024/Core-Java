Object----java.lang package
1.It is a super most class for all class in java

there are totally 11 methods inside this
-----------------
1.toString()--it prints the memory address
2.equals()--It is checking the memory location,if it is same then true otherwise false
3.hasCode()---memory address in the form of integer
4.wait()---overloaded 3 times
5.notify()
6.notifyAll()
7.getClass() - in reflection
8.clone() - duplicate object
9.finalize() - garbage collector


How Garbage collector is working in Java?
---------------------------------------
or
How auto memory management of Java is working?
---------------------------------------
or
How finalize() method is working in java?
--------------------------------------
When ever any object becomes null then it is useless or abandoned
means no further use.
This type of object is simply wasting the memory
to remove the memory located by these object we need to make a request to garbage collector.
we can make request to garbage collector by two ways
1.System.gc()
2.Runtime.getRuntime().gc();
Garbage collector is scanning the whole memory and finding the list of null object.
at the end it is internally calling the finalize() method of Object class to remove
the all null object.

If null objects are not there then finalize method is not called
