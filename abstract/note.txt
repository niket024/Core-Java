void test();----unimplemented method
void test1()----implemented method
{

}

test1();
abstract class
-----------------
It is a collection of implemented and unimplemented method
Rule:
--------------
1.We can't create an object of abstract class
2.When any concrete class inherit abstract class then we must have to override the
unimplemented method
3. We can keep constructor in abstract class
