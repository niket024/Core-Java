Difference between Abstract class and Interface
-----------------------------------
1.we can't extends more than one class in abstract 
  class but in interface we can
2.we can keep constructor in abstract class but can't in interface
3.In abstract class both implemented and unimplemented but in 
  interface only unimplemented
4.In abstract class methods are not by default public and abstract
but in interface
5.In abstract class we are using extends but in interface implements
6. In interface by default variables are public static and final 
but same is not in abstract class
